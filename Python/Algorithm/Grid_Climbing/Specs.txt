Congratulations! You’ve made it to the finals of the World Grid Climbing competition. You start at the bottom-left corner of an n×m grid and are only allowed to climb rightwards or upwards. Each grid position (i, j) has a score S[i, j]. (The bottom-left position is (0,0) and the top-right is (n-1, m-1).) You have an energy budget of B. Moving right costs c_r >= 0  amount of energy and moving up costs c_u >= 0. A climbing path consists of a sequence of rightwards and upwards moves and is feasible if the total energy cost is at most the budget. The goal is to find the maximum total score that can be obtained by a feasible climbing path.
